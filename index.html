                <p><b>Etruria</b> was born out of the dream of <b>Bruno</b>, who inherited these lands from his grandparents in the <b>1966</b>.<br>
                The art of winemaking was transmitted through the generations, to his chidren first and grandchildren then.<br>
                <b>Elia</b>, <b>Paolo</b> and <b>Andrea</b> run the family business now, and they dedicate all their passion and efforts to keep alive the traditions, which Bruno had thought them.</p>

                <h1>The vineyard</h1>
                <p>The vineyard is situated in Tuscany, the hearth of the territory once called <b>Etruria</b>,
                 and the cultivated area extends on a surface of 2 hectars. <br>
                 Planted with <b>Sangiovese</b>, <b>Malvasia Nera</b>, <b>Vermentino</b> and <b>Moscato</b>, the composition of the terroir 
                 allows the grapes to maintain their unique variety of flavours, fruit of the great history of these lands.
